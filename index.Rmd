## Question 5 a)

Open the documentation for `sample()`.

```{r function-doc, exercise=TRUE}

```

## Question 5 b)

Complete the following script to  to simulate $N=1,000,000$ rounds of 4 card draws and estimate
the probabilities of the specified events.

```{r sim-cards, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=25}
N <- 10^6 # 1,000,000 simulations
sims <- matrix(sample(c(
 # code the card values
), 4 # complete this line
sumA <- # store simulated sums for player A
sumB <- # store simulated sums for player B
# compute the probability estimates
```
